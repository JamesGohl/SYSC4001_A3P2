# SYSC4001_A3P2
FOR PART A make sure you are in the Part folderchmod +x build.sh./build.sh./bin/TaMarkingPartA <num_TAs>
To compile and run the program, run the individual build files for 
part A and for part B, located in their own folders. Once the 
code has been compiled you can run the executable in the terminal using:
- ./bin/TaMarkingPartA <num_TAs>      
- ./bin/TaMarkingPartB <num_TAs>

The number of TAs must be more than 2.

This repository contains the solution for **SYSC 4001 Assignment 3 Part 2**.

## Quick Start

To compile and run either part, follow the steps below.

---

## Part A
1. Go to the PartA folder:
```bash
cd PartA
```
2. Make the build script executable:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```
3. Compile the program:

```bash
./build.sh
```
Run the program with the number of TAs you want (must be ≥ 2):

```bash
./bin/TaMarkingPartA <num_TAs>
```
The program prints the actions of each TA marking exams and updating the rubric.

## Part B
1. Go to the PartB folder:
```bash
cd PartB
```
2. Make the build script executable:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```
3. Compile the program:

```bash
./build.sh
```
Run the program with the number of TAs you want (must be ≥ 2):

```bash
./bin/TaMarkingPartB <num_TAs>
```
The program prints the actions of each TA marking exams and updating the rubric.
